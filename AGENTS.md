## Project Overview

- **Name**: Jonggrang-desktop
- **Type**: api
- **Stack**: node-typescript
- **Description**: TODO - describe what this project does

---

## Conventions

### File Structure
```
TODO - document your project's file structure pattern
Example:
src/
├── routes/       # API route handlers
├── services/     # Business logic
├── models/       # Database models/schemas
├── middleware/    # Express/framework middleware
├── utils/        # Shared utilities
└── types/        # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Database tables: `snake_case`
- API endpoints: `kebab-case`

### Code Patterns
- TODO - document patterns used in this project
- Example: "All route handlers follow: validate input -> call service -> format response"
- Example: "Use Zod for all runtime validation"
- Example: "Error responses always use format: { error: string, code: string }"

### Testing Conventions
- Framework: none
- Command: echo 'no test command configured'
- Pattern: TODO - describe your test patterns
- Example: "Integration tests use a real test database, not mocks"
- Example: "Each test file has its own setup/teardown"

---

## Known Gotchas

- TODO - document things that are surprising or non-obvious
- Example: "Prisma unique constraint errors throw P2002, need explicit handling"
- Example: "Test database needs cleanup between runs — use beforeEach, not beforeAll"
- Example: "The auth middleware reads from both cookie and Authorization header"

---

## Architecture Decisions

- TODO - document why things are the way they are
- Example: "We use JWT instead of sessions because the API serves mobile + web"
- Example: "Chose Drizzle over Prisma for better type inference and SQL control"
- Example: "Monorepo with turborepo because shared types between API and web"

---

## Dependencies & Integrations

- TODO - document external service integrations
- Example: "Email via SendGrid — API key in SENDGRID_API_KEY env var"
- Example: "File uploads go to S3 bucket defined in AWS_S3_BUCKET"
- Example: "Auth tokens are RS256 signed — public key at /api/auth/.well-known/jwks.json"

---

## Development Setup

```bash
# TODO - document how to run the project locally
# Example:
# cp .env.example .env
# docker-compose up -d    # Start database
# npm install
# npm run db:migrate       # Run migrations
# npm run dev              # Start dev server
```

---

## Jonggrang Workflow

Jonggrang uses a **two-phase planning** flow so humans can review and edit a plan before AI decomposes it into tasks.

### Full workflow

```bash
# Phase 1 — generate a human-readable draft plan
jonggrang plan "add JWT authentication"
# → AI writes .jonggrang/plan.md (high-level, no tasks yet)
# → Interactive options:
#     Approve           → run Phase 2 immediately
#     Edit with AI      → describe changes, AI revises plan, loop back
#     Edit in $EDITOR   → open editor, loop back
#     Save draft        → exit, run "jonggrang approve" later
#     Abort             → discard plan.md

# Resume after accidental close:
jonggrang plan
# → no description → shows list of pending + archived plans
# → pick one → shows plan + interactive options again

# Phase 2 — approve plan → decompose into tasks
jonggrang approve
# → AI reads .jonggrang/plan.md → runs `jonggrang task import` to create tasks
# → plan.md is archived to .jonggrang/.output/features/<featureId>/plan.md

# Execute tasks
jonggrang work
```

### Shorthand options

```bash
# Plan + auto-approve + tasks in one shot (skips human review)
jonggrang plan "add JWT auth" --yes

# Deep mode: 3-phase analysis (discovery + brainstorm + condense) → enriched plan
# Adds Affected Areas, Risks, and Alternatives Considered sections to plan.md
jonggrang plan "add JWT auth" --deep

# Deep mode + auto-approve in one shot
jonggrang plan "add JWT auth" --deep --yes

# Full pipeline: plan → approve → execute in one shot
jonggrang work "add JWT auth" --yes

# Execute existing tasks only (skip pending plan warning)
jonggrang work --ignore-plan
```

### Modifying an approved plan

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Add new scope on top of done work | `jonggrang plan "also add rate limiting"` |
| Change remaining pending work | `jonggrang plan "use Passport.js instead"` |
| Undo completed tasks | Not supported — create new tasks to override |

**Rule: completed tasks are immutable.** They reflect real code. Any correction must be a new task that fixes/replaces the previous implementation.

### Plan file format

```markdown
---
feature: jwt-auth
branch: feat/jwt-auth
work_type: MEDIUM
description: JWT authentication with login, register, refresh
created_at: 2026-04-16T10:30:00Z
---

# Plan: JWT Authentication

## Approach
...

## Phases
1. DB schema — users + refresh_tokens
2. Auth service — register/login/refresh
3. JWT middleware
...

## Key Decisions
- Token storage: httpOnly cookie

## Out of Scope
- OAuth, 2FA, email verification
```

---

## Bug Reporting

When you discover a defect **outside the scope of your current task**, report it immediately:

```bash
# Report a bug and create a BUGFIX task in one shot
jonggrang bug "description of what is broken" --feature <feature_id>
# When asked "Create a task now?" → y

# Or save for later (batch convert)
jonggrang bug "description" --feature <feature_id>
# When asked "Create a task now?" → n
jonggrang bug convert --feature <feature_id>   # converts all open bugs to tasks later
```

Get the `feature_id` by running: `jonggrang task show <id>` — look for the `feature_id` field in the output.

**Rules:**
- Do NOT fix out-of-scope bugs inline — stay focused on your current task
- Report real defects only (crashes, wrong return values, broken edge cases)
- Do NOT report style issues, TODOs, or future features — those go in the plan

Bug reports are saved to `.jonggrang/.output/features/<feature_id>/bugs.md` and can be viewed with:
```bash
jonggrang bug list
```

---

## Task Management CLI

Use the `jonggrang task` CLI to manage tasks instead of editing `.jonggrang/jonggrang-tasks.json` directly.

### Commands

```bash
# List & inspect
jonggrang task list                         # list all tasks (JSON output)
jonggrang task list pending                 # filter by status
jonggrang task show task-001                # show task detail
jonggrang task next                         # show next eligible task

# Create & modify
jonggrang task add --title "Add login page" --priority 1
jonggrang task add --title "Write tests" --blocked-by task-001
jonggrang task update task-001 --status in_progress
jonggrang task update task-001 --files src/login.ts,src/login.test.ts

# Complete & block
jonggrang task done task-001                # mark completed + passes=true
jonggrang task block task-002 --reason "Waiting for API spec"

# Remove (cleans up blocked_by refs)
jonggrang task remove task-003
```

### Output

- Default output is **JSON** (machine-readable for agents)
- Add `--pretty` for human-readable table format
- Add `--json` to force JSON when in a TTY

### Available flags for add/update

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--title` | Task title |
| `--desc` | Task description |
| `--priority` | Priority (1 = highest) |
| `--status` | pending, in_progress, completed, blocked, waiting, skipped |
| `--skill` | Skill name |
| `--blocked-by` | Comma-separated dependency task IDs |
| `--files` | Comma-separated file paths |
| `--reason` | Reason (used with `block`) |
