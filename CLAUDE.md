# CLAUDE.md — Jonggrang Project Instructions

This project is managed by **Jonggrang**, an AI development workflow orchestrator.

## Before You Start

Read these files in order:
1. `.claude/SKILL.md` — Full agent protocol (how to execute tasks)
2. `AGENTS.md` — Project-specific conventions and patterns
3. `.jonggrang/progress.txt` — Learnings from previous sessions
4. `.jonggrang/jonggrang.json` — Project config

Then run `jonggrang task next` to find your task assignment — do NOT read `.jonggrang/jonggrang-tasks.json` directly.

## Quick Protocol

1. Read context files above
2. Find your task: `jonggrang task next` (or `jonggrang task show <id>`)
3. If task has `"skill"` field, read `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
4. Start work: `jonggrang task update <id> --status in_progress`
5. Implement the task following AGENTS.md conventions
6. Run validation: typecheck, tests, lint
7. Mark done: `jonggrang task done <id>`
8. Append learnings to `.jonggrang/progress.txt`
9. Commit with: `git commit -m "type(scope): description"`

## Project Info

- **Name**: Jonggrang-desktop
- **Type**: api
- **Stack**: node-typescript
- **Test command**: echo 'no test command configured'

## Bug Reporting

If you find a defect **outside the scope of your current task**, report it:

```bash
jonggrang bug "description of what is broken" --feature <feature_id>
# "Create a task now?" → y
```

- Bug is saved to `.jonggrang/.output/features/<feature_id>/bugs.md`
- A BUGFIX task is created immediately and queued for the next work cycle
- Do NOT fix out-of-scope bugs inline — complete your current task first

Get the `feature_id` by running: `jonggrang task show <id>` — look for the `feature_id` field in the output.

## Rules

- Only modify files listed in your task's `"files"` array
- Follow patterns in AGENTS.md
- One atomic commit per task
- Do not skip validation
- Log discoveries in `.jonggrang/progress.txt`
- Report out-of-scope bugs with `jonggrang bug` (see above)
